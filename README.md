## Returning Visitor Goals
- A returning visitor’s purpose for using the app would be to either find a dining spot based on other users’ experiences or to add to the library a new dining spot they have personally visited.
- A returning visitor should be able to quickly browse through the library of dining spots collected on the app.
  - A returning visitor should be able to quickly and easily log in to the app.
- A returning visitor should be able to contribute to the library upon logging in. 
  - A returning visitor should be able to edit his/her own entries to the library.
